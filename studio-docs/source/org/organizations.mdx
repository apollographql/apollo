All data in Apollo Studio (GraphQL schemas, metrics, etc.) belongs to a particular organization. Every organization has one or more [members](./members/) who manage it and can access its associated data.

> **Important**: Currently, all members of a Studio organization have full permissions for the organization, including the ability to delete graphs or transfer them out of the organization.

## Creating an organization

You create your first organization as part of [account creation](./account/), unless you've been invited to an existing organization by another Studio user.

You can create additional organizations by clicking the `+` button at the top of your list of organizations in [Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). A single Studio organization can include any number of [graphs](./graphs/), so a company rarely needs more than one or two organizations.

## Viewing your organizations

[Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com) lists the organizations you belong to in the left-hand column.

* Click on an organization to view its associated schemas and metrics.
* Click the gear icon next to an organization to view its settings.

## Deleting an organization

Deleting an organization requires contacting Apollo. You can do so from your organization's Settings tab.

Deleting an organization does not affect the uptime of services that send data
to Studio as part of that organization.

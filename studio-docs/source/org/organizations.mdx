All data in Apollo Studio (GraphQL schemas, metrics, etc.) belongs to a particular organization. Every organization has one or more [members](./members/) who manage it and can access its associated data. Enterprise organizations can also assign specific [roles](./members/#organization-wide-member-roles) to users in the organization.

## Creating an organization

You create your first organization as part of [the user signup process](./account/), unless you've been invited to an existing organization by another Studio user.

You can create additional organizations by clicking the `+` button at the top of your list of organizations in [Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). A single Studio organization can include any number of [graphs](./graphs/), so a company rarely needs more than one or two organizations.

## Viewing your organizations

[Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com) lists the organizations you belong to in the left-hand column.

* Click on an organization to view its associated schemas and metrics.
* Each organization has a **Graphs** list, a **Members** management page, and a **Settings** page.

## Deleting an organization

You can delete an organization at any time. This is a permanent action that cannot be undone, and will remove all traces of your organization from Studio's system.
Deleting your organization will:

* Remove all user memberships from your organizations.
* Permanently delete all graphs from your organization, and their associated data. These graph IDs cannot be reused later.
* Immediately terminate the Team subscription or Team Trial on your account, if you have one. We can't issue refunds for this, unfortunately.

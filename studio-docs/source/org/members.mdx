A Studio organization can have any number of members, and each member can be assigned a **role** that defines their capabilities within the organization.

## Member roles

> **Member roles are available for Enterprise accounts.**
>
> Apollo Support can also grant access to the Billing Manager role for Team accounts on request. Please contact support@apollographql.com for more information.
>
> If you're using member roles, [please let us know what you think!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10C4_ETX5Xb60RfnJjBC2xBVK9gjr6A644AYKA-27T-E/viewform) Your feedback will help us improve the feature before we roll it out to all organizations.
>
> If roles are **not** enabled for your organization, all members can perform all actions described in [Role permissions](#role-permissions).

Each organization member has one of the following roles:

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Admin`           | Has management access to the entire organization, including its members, graphs, and configuration.                                                                                                                |
| `Contributor`     | Has management access to the organization's graphs, but not to members or organization-level configuration. Intended for back-end developers who are authorized to make changes to graphs.                         |
| `Observer`        | Has view-only access to the organization's graph data, such as schemas and metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for back-end developers who are _not_ authorized to make changes to graphs. |
| `Consumer`        | Has view-only access to the organization's graph _schemas_, but not metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for application developers building clients against a graph.                       |
| `Billing Manager` | Has management access to organization-level configuration and billing. Can also remove members (but not invite them). No access to graphs.                                                                         |

Only admins can assign roles to other members. You can see which role you have in a particular organization from your [user settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings), or from that organization's Members tab.

## Inviting members

[Admins](#member-roles) can invite individual members by email address from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). Admins can also create a persistent **invite link** from the organization's Settings tab, which can be used to invite any number of members. Using either method, an admin can specify which role a new member receives.

> **Do not share invite links publicly.** Anyone with the link can join your organization. If an invite link becomes compromised, an admin can replace or disable it from the Settings tab.

## Removing members

Both [admins and billing managers](#member-roles) can remove members from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com).

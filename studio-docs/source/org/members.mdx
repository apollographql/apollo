A Studio organization can have any number of members, and each member can be assigned a **role** that defines their capabilities within the organization.

## Organization-wide member roles

> **Member roles are available for organizations with an Enterprise plan.**
>
> Apollo Support can also grant complimentary access to the Billing Manager role for Team accounts on request. Please contact **support@apollographql.com** for more information.
>
> If you're using member roles, [please let us know what you think!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10C4_ETX5Xb60RfnJjBC2xBVK9gjr6A644AYKA-27T-E/viewform) Your feedback will help us improve the feature before we roll it out to all organizations.
>
> If roles are **not** enabled for your organization, all members can perform all actions described in [Role permissions](#role-permissions).

Each organization member has one of the following roles:

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Organization Admin` | Has management access to the entire organization, including its members, graphs, and configuration.                                                                                                                |
| `Graph Admin`        | Has management access to the organization's graphs, but not to members or organization-level configuration. Intended for developers who are considered admins to the graph.                                        |
| `Contributor`        | Can push new schemas to graphs, but cannot configure graph settings or integrations. Intended for back-end developers who are authorized to make changes to graphs. _Cannot_ push schema changes to [protected variants](./graphs/#protected-variants-enterprise-only).                                               |
| `Observer`           | Has view-only access to the organization's graph data, such as schemas and metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for back-end developers who are _not_ authorized to make changes to graphs. |
| `Consumer`           | Has view-only access to the organization's graph _schemas_, but not metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for application developers building clients against a graph.                       |
| `Billing Manager`    | Has management access to organization-level configuration and billing. Can also remove members (but not invite them). No access to graphs.                                                                         |

Only members with the `Organization Admin` role can assign roles to other members. You can see which role you have in a particular organization from your [user settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings), or from the organization's Members tab.

## Graph-specific member roles

You can override a member's organization-wide role for individual graphs. For example, if a member has the `Observer` role in your organization, you can assign them the `Contributor` role for a graph that they need extra access to.

> A member's graph-specific role must have _more_ permissions than their organization-wide role.

Members with the `Graph Admin` or `Organization Admin` role can assign graph-specific roles from the Access tab of the graph's Settings page.

If a graph is made [hidden](./graphs/#setting-graph-visibility-enterprise-only), then only users with explicit overrides (as well as `Org Admins`) can see the graph.

`Graph Admins` and `Org Admins` have exactly the same permissions on graphs, so you can only grant a `Graph Admin` override, not an (equivalent) `Org Admin` override.

When `Contributors` in an organization create a new graph, they are automatically granted the `Graph Admin` role on that graph.

> Currently, graph usage metrics and traces are not displayed to `Consumer`s via the Studio web app but they are not blocked at the API layer. We intend to remove this capability from `Consumer`s, but for the time being you should understand that `Consumer`s are not fully prevented from accessing these metrics and traces.

> In January 2021, we made three changes to our role structure:
> - We removed the ability of `Observers` to view integration settings, as some of these settings contain sensitive information.
> - We significantly reduced the permissions of the `Contributor` role, making it much closer to `Observer` plus the ability to perform a small set of write operations on non-protected variants.
> - We added the `Graph Admin` role. This role is nearly identical to the former `Contributor` role; as part of the transition, we changed all existing `Contributors` to `Graph Admins`. The only difference between the old `Contributor` role and the new `Graph Admin` role is that `Graph Admins` can delete graphs (and manage graph overrides, a new feature released simultaneously).

### Billing Managers
`Billing Managers` cannot see or manage graphs in their organizations, but they can:
- Remove members from the organization
- View and edit billing information (including changing the billing plan)
- Manage organization configuration (name, avatar, etc.)

Notably, `Billing Managers` cannot invite new members to the organization or update roles.

### Dev Graphs

[Development Graphs](/dev-graphs/) are a special case in our permissions system.
Any user in an organization (even a `Consumer`) can create a dev graph and act as the `Graph Admin` for it. Dev graphs are private to the users who create them: even `Org Admins` cannot view them, and they cannot currently be shared with other users.

## Graph key roles

Each [graph API key](../api-keys/) also has a corresponding member role. Like graph overrides, this role may be `Graph Admin` (the default), `Contributor`, `Observer`, or `Consumer`. Graph API keys may only act on the graph associated with the key, and cannot perform any operations on organizations or users. They are otherwise equivalent in power to a user with the same role on the graph. For example, `Consumer` keys can be used to fetch the graph schema, and `Graph Admin` keys can be used to manage integrations.

There are a few operations that are not listed in the chart above because they are *only* supported by graph API keys, not personal API keys for users in the graph's organization. These are primarily operations that are performed by your GraphQL server. They are:

- Reporting usage (traces and performance metrics). This requires a `Graph Admin` key, or a `Contributor` key if the variant is not protected.
- [Registering operations](../operation-registry/). This requires a `Graph Admin` key.

Before January 2021, graph keys did not have roles. Keys created before that date (which are shown as `Legacy Admin` keys) can perform the following operations:
- Create new variants
- Run schema checks
- View and manage graph API keys
- Push schemas to a graph
- See the schemas of implementing services in federated graphs
- View graph schemas and changelogs
- Modify schema checks configuration


## Inviting members

**Organization admins** can invite individual members by email address from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). Organization admins can also create a persistent **invite link** from the organization's Settings tab, which can be used to invite any number of members. Using either method, an org admin can specify which role a new member receives.

> **Do not share invite links publicly.** Anyone with the link can join your organization. If an invite link becomes compromised, an admin can replace or disable it from the Settings tab.

## Removing members

Both **organization admins** and **billing managers** can remove members from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com).

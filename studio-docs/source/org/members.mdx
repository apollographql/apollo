A Studio organization can have any number of members, and each member can be assigned a **role** that defines their capabilities within the organization.

## Organization-wide member roles

Each organization member has one of the following roles:

> If you're using member roles, [please let us know what you think!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10C4_ETX5Xb60RfnJjBC2xBVK9gjr6A644AYKA-27T-E/viewform) Your feedback will help us improve the feature before we roll it out to all organizations.


| Name | Description | Supported [plan types](https://www.apollographql.com/pricing/) |
| ---- | ----------- | :------------------: |
| `Org Admin` | Has management access to the entire organization, including its members, graphs, and configuration. | All |
| `Graph Admin`        | Has management access to the organization's graphs, but not to members or organization-level configuration. Intended for developers who are considered admins to the graph. | Enterprise only |
| `Contributor`        | Can push new schemas to graphs, but cannot configure graph settings or integrations. Intended for back-end developers who are authorized to make changes to graphs. _Cannot_ push schema changes to [protected variants](./graphs/#protected-variants-enterprise-only). | Enterprise only |
| `Observer` | Has view-only access to the organization's graph data, such as schemas and metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for back-end developers who are _not_ authorized to make changes to graphs. | Enterprise only |
| `Consumer` (free)        | <p>Has view-only access to the organization's graph _schemas_, but not metrics. Can also execute queries in the Explorer. Intended for application developers building clients against a graph.</p><p>This role is available to all plan types, including Free. `Consumer` members do not count as billed users.</p> | All |
| `Billing Manager` (free)   | <p>Has management access to organization-level configuration and billing. Can also remove members (but not invite them). No access to graphs.

Only members with the `Org Admin` role can assign roles to other members. You can see which role you have in a particular organization from your [user settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings), or from the organization's Members tab.

## Graph-specific member roles

You can override a member's organization-wide role for individual graphs. For example, if a member has the `Observer` role in your organization, you can assign them the `Contributor` role for a graph that they need extra access to.

> A member's graph-specific role must have _more_ permissions than their organization-wide role.

Members with the `Graph Admin` or `Org Admin` role can assign graph-specific roles from the Access tab of the graph's Settings page.

If a graph is made [hidden](./graphs/#internal-graph-visibility-enterprise-only), then only users with explicit overrides (as well as `Org Admins`) can see the graph.

`Graph Admins` and `Org Admins` have exactly the same permissions on graphs, so you can only grant a `Graph Admin` override, not an (equivalent) `Org Admin` override.

When `Contributors` in an organization create a new graph, they are automatically granted the `Graph Admin` role for that graph.

> Currently, graph usage metrics and traces are not displayed to `Consumer`s via the Studio web app but they are not blocked at the API layer. We intend to remove this capability from `Consumer`s, but for the time being you should understand that `Consumer`s are not fully prevented from accessing these metrics and traces.

> In January 2021, we made the following changes to our role structure:
> - We removed the ability of `Observer`s to view integration settings, because some of these settings contain sensitive information.
> - We significantly reduced the permissions of the `Contributor` role, making it much closer to `Observer` plus the ability to perform a small set of write operations on non-protected variants.
> - We added the `Graph Admin` role. This role is nearly identical to the former `Contributor` role. As part of the transition, we changed all existing `Contributor`s to `Graph Admin`s. The only difference between the old `Contributor` role and the new `Graph Admin` role is that `Graph Admin`s can delete graphs (and manage graph overrides, a new feature released simultaneously).

### Billing managers

Members with the `Billing Manager` role can't see or manage graphs in their organizations, but they can:

- Remove members from the organization
- View and edit billing information (including changing the billing plan)
- Manage organization configuration (name, avatar, etc.)

Notably, `Billing Manager`s can't invite new members to the organization or update roles.

### Dev graphs

[Development Graphs](/dev-graphs/) are a special case in our permissions system. Any user in an organization (even a `Consumer`) can create a dev graph and act as its `Graph Admin`. Each dev graph is private to the user who creates it. Even `Org Admin`s can't view them, and they can't currently be shared with other users.

## Graph API key roles

Each [graph API key](../api-keys/) also has a corresponding member role. This role can be `Graph Admin` (the default), `Contributor`, `Observer`, or `Consumer`. A graph API key provides access only to its associated graph. It does not provide access to actions associated with organizations or users.

Otherwise, a graph API key is equivalent in privileges to a user with the same role for the graph. For example, you can use a `Consumer` key to fetch a graph's schema, and you can use a `Graph Admin` key to manage integrations.

A few operations aren't listed in the table above because they are *only* supported by graph API keys, not personal API keys for users in the graph's organization. These are primarily operations that are performed by your GraphQL server. They are:

- Reporting usage (traces and performance metrics). This requires a `Graph Admin` key, or a `Contributor` key if the variant is not protected.
- [Registering operations](../operation-registry/). This requires a `Graph Admin` key.

> Before January 2021, graph keys did not have roles. Keys created before that date (shown as `Legacy Admin` keys) can perform the following operations:
>
> - Create new variants
> - Run schema checks
> - View and manage graph API keys
> - Push schemas to a graph
> - See the schemas of subgraphs in federated graphs
> - View graph schemas and changelogs
> - Modify schema checks configuration


## Inviting members

`Org Admin`s can invite individual members by email address from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com). Organization admins can also create a persistent **invite link** from the organization's Settings tab, which can be used to invite any number of members. Using either method, an org admin can specify which role a new member receives.

> **Do not share invite links publicly.** Anyone with the link can join your organization. If an invite link becomes compromised, an admin can replace or disable it from the Settings tab.

## Removing members

Both `Org Admin`s and `Billing Manager`s can remove members from your organization's Members tab in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com).

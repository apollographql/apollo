A **graph** in Apollo Studio represents a connected data graph in your organization. Each graph has one or more **variants**, which correspond to the different environments where the graph runs (such as staging and production). Each variant has its own GraphQL schema, which means schemas can differ between environments.

## Creating a graph

To create a graph in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/), first select the Studio organization that the graph will belong to. Then click **New Graph** in the upper right and proceed through the creation flow:

There are two types of graphs in Studio:

* **Deployed graphs** are shared with other members of your organization. Create a deployed graph for every use case _except_ local development.
* **Development graphs** (**dev graphs** for short) are only visible to you. Use them to help you iterate on your graph in your development environment.

## Registering a schema

You can register your schema to a Studio graph with one of the following methods:

* [Using schema reporting](../schema/schema-reporting/) (recommended)
* [Using the Apollo CLI](../schema/cli-registration/)

## Viewing graph information

After selecting an organization in Studio, click on a particular graph
to view its schema, data, and settings. All of a Studio organization's members can access the data and settings for every graph that belongs to that organization.

> Enterprise accounts can set [member roles](./members/#organization-wide-member-roles) to configure access for individual members of their organization.

### Exploring your schema

Apollo Studio provides a powerful **Explorer** IDE that helps you visualize your graph and run queries against it. It's available from your graph's Explorer tab in Studio.

> [Learn about the Apollo Studio Explorer](../explorer/)

### Tracking schema changes

The History view in Apollo Studio lets you view the timeline of changes made to your graph's schema:

**Only schema changes that you push to Studio are included in this timeline**, which is one of the most important reasons to [include schema registration in your continuous delivery pipeline](../schema/cli-registration/#registering-with-continuous-delivery).

## Setting graph visibility (Enterprise only)

By default, deployed graphs are visible to all members of your organization. If you have an Enterprise plan, you can set a deployed graph to instead be visible only to members you invite. 

You can configure visibility and grant your organization's members explicit access to your graph from the Access tab of your graph's Settings page.

`Organization Admins` can see all graphs in your organization though, regardless of if they are **visible** or **hidden**.

## Managing variants

To distinguish between instances of the same graph running in different environments (such as staging and production), you can define **variants** for a deployed graph. Each variant has its own schema, along with its own change history, metrics, and operation registry.

> Development graphs do **not** support variants.

### Adding a variant

To add a variant to your graph, you [register a schema](#registering-a-schema) to the graph and include a variation name in the registration. If a variation with the specified name doesn't exist yet, Studio creates it.

### Associating metrics with a variant

You can configure Apollo Server to associate the metrics it sends to Apollo Studio with a particular variant. To do so, set the `APOLLO_GRAPH_VARIANT` environment variable (`ENGINE_SCHEMA_TAG` in `apollo-server` pre-2.13.0) to the appropriate variant before initializing Apollo Server.

> Make sure you associate metrics with the correct variant! Otherwise, metrics from your staging and test environments will be included in reports for your production graph.

### Protected variants (Enterprise only)

If you have an Enterprise plan, you can designate particular variants of a graph as **protected variants**. Making a variant protected specifically affects the ability of users with the [`Contributor` role](/org/members/#organization-wide-member-roles) to make certain changes to the variant:
- `Contributor`s _cannot_ push schema updates to a protected variant.
- `Contributors` _cannot_ manage Explorer-related settings for a protected variant, like setting its URL.
- Graph API Keys with the `Contributor` permission will not be able to report usage metrics to your graph.

These are the only operations (other than creating new protected variants and creating new graphs) that can be performed by `Contributor`s and not by `Observer`s, so one way of thinking of protected variants are that they are variants where `Contributor`s are treated as `Observer`s.

`Graph Admins` and `Org Admins` can configure whether a variant is protected from the Access tab of the graph's Settings page.

## Transferring graph ownership

You can transfer a graph to a different Studio organization you belong to
by visiting the graph's Settings page and changing the **graph owner**.

## Deleting a graph

> **Deleting a graph cannot be undone!**

You can delete a graph from Studio by visiting its Settings page and clicking
**Delete**.

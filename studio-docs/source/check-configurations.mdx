title: Configuring schema checks
description: Define exactly what schema changes are checked against
---

After you [enable schema checks](./schema-checks/) for your graph, you can define rules to customize their behavior. For example, you can:

* Exclude past operations that were executed by a particular client, such as a client that you only use for testing
* Check schema changes against multiple graph variants simultaneously

You define these rules in [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com), from the Configuration tab of your graph's Checks page:

## Configuration options

* **Time range**: _Include_ all distinct operations that were executed within this range. The default value is 7 days ("Within the last week").
* **Operation count threshold**: _Exclude_ all operations that were executed fewer than this number of times within the specified **time range**.
* **Variants**: _Include_ all distinct operations that were executed against each selected variant of your graph. The default value is "Base variant" (i.e., whichever variant schema checks are being run against).
* **Client exclusions**: _Exclude_ all operations that were executed by particular clients, such as clients used exclusively for development and testing.

Every application that sends data to Apollo must use an **API key** to do so. Apollo Studio enables you to create and manage two types of API keys: **graph API keys** and **personal API keys**. Every system that _isn't_ running as part of your local development setup should always use a graph API key.

## Graph API keys

A graph API key provides access to a **single graph** in Apollo Studio. A GraphQL server (such as Apollo Server) can use a graph API key to register its schema and push metrics to Studio.

Create a unique graph API key for each non-development system that communicates with Studio. Doing so enables you to revoke access to a single system without affecting others.

### Setting permissions

Unless you have an Enterprise plan, every graph API key provides **full access** to its associated graph.

If you have an Enterprise plan, you can [assign a member role](/org/members/#member-roles) to each graph API key you create. If you do, the API key's permissions are limited to that role's permissions.

You can't change a graph API key's role after it's created. Instead, create a new key with the desired role.

## Personal API keys

A personal API key provides partial access to **every graph in every organization you belong to**. A personal API key has the same permissions that your user account has in each of your organizations. 

You can use personal API keys with local development tools (like the Apollo [CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/) and [VS Code extension](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/)) to load schemas and other data from Studio.

However, a [graph API key](#graph-api-keys) is required for almost all other Studio interactions, including:

* Schema registration via [schema reporting](../schema/schema-reporting/)
* [Metrics reporting](../setup-analytics/)

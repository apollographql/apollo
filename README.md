We are bringing your data stack to the moon and back (for modern apps), brought to you by [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/). Reactively connect any backend data source to any client.

This is the main repository for discussion and coordination - the code will live elsewhere. Follow this repository for updates on the project!

## Inviting members

Invite individual members by email address from your organization's Members tab.

You can also create an **invite link** from your organization's Settings tab. Any number of individuals can use the same invite link.

> **Do not share your invite link publicly.** Anyone with the link can join your organization. If your invite link becomes compromised, you can replace or disable it from the Settings tab.

## Removing members

Remove members from your organization's Members tab.

> Currently, any member of an organization can remove any _other_ member
from the organization.

## Creating your account

To create your Apollo account, visit [studio.apollographql.com](https://studio.apollographql.com) and click **Create an account**. You can sign
up either with an email and password, or with an existing GitHub account.

If you sign up with GitHub, Studio uses your GitHub identity only for
login verification purposes. It does not request access to any of your GitHub
data.

>Single sign-on (SSO) account management via SAML or OIDC is available for [Enterprise customers](https://www.apollographql.com/plans/).

Unless another Studio user has invited you to join an existing organization,
you also [create an organization](./org-organizations/) as part of the account
creation process.

## Deleting your account

Deleting your account requires contacting Apollo. You can do so from your 
[Personal Settings page](https://engine.apollographql.com/user-settings).

Every application that sends data to Apollo must use an **API key** to do so. Apollo Studio enables you to create and manage two types of API keys: **graph API keys** and **personal API keys**. Every system that _isn't_ running as part of your local development setup should always use a graph API key.

## Graph API keys

A graph API key provides **full** access to a **single graph** in Apollo Studio. A GraphQL server (such as Apollo Server) can use a graph API key to register its schema and push metrics to Studio.

Create a unique graph API key for each non-development system that communicates with Studio. Doing so enables you to revoke access to a single system without affecting others.

## Personal API keys

A personal API key provides **partial** access to **every graph in every organization you belong to**. Specifically, the Apollo [CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/) and [VS Code extension](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/editor-plugins/) support personal API keys, but all other Studio interactions require a graph API key.

Interactions that require a graph API key include:

* Schema registration via [schema reporting](../schema/schema-reporting/)
* [Metrics reporting](../setup-analytics/)


Every interaction that's performed using a personal API key is associated with the corresponding user.

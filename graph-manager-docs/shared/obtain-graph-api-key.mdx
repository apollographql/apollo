<ExpansionPanel title="How to obtain a graph API key">

> **Graph API keys are secret credentials.** Never share them outside your organization or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised.

1. Go to [engine.apollographql.com](https://engine.apollographql.com/) and select the graph you want to generate an API key for.

2. Open the graph's Settings page and scroll down to the API Keys section. Click **Create New Key**.

3. Optionally click the `â€¦` button to the right of the API key to give it a name, such as `Production`. This helps you keep track of each API key's use.

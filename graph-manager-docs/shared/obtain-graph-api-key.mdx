<ExpansionPanel title="How to obtain a graph API key">

> **API keys are secret credentials.** Never share them outside your organization or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised.

1. Go to [engine.apollographql.com](https://engine.apollographql.com/) and click the graph you want to obtain an API key for.

2. **If a "Publish your Schema" dialog appears**, select the **From Apollo Server** tab. Copy the value that appears after `APOLLO_KEY=` in the instructions (it begins with `service:`).

    **Otherwise**, proceed to the next step.

2. Open your graph's Settings page and scroll down to the API Keys section. Either copy an existing key or click **Create New Key**.

3. Optionally click the `…` button to the right of the API key to give it a name, such as `Production`. This helps you keep track of each API key's use.

<ExpansionPanel title="How to obtain a personal API key">

> **Personal API keys are secret credentials.** Never share them with others or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised.

1. Go to [studio.apollographql.com/user-settings](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings).

2. In the Personal API Key section, click **Create New Key**. Your new API key appears in the Token column of the table.

3. Optionally click the `â€¦` button to the right of the API key to give it a name, such as `Local development laptop`. This helps you keep track of each API key's use.

4. Copy the key's value.

<ExpansionPanel title="How to obtain a personal API key">

> **Personal API keys are secret credentials.** Never share them or commit them to version control. Delete and replace API keys that you believe are compromised.

1. Go to [engine.apollographql.com/user-settings](https://engine.apollographql.com/user-settings).

2. In the Personal API Key section, click **Create New Key**. Your new API key appears in the Token column of the table.

3. Optionally click the `…` button to the right of the API key to give it a name, such as `Local development laptop`. This helps you keep track of each API key's use.

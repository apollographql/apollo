# Apollo docs

The Apollo docs website is actually several individual websites, glued together using Netlify redirects (proxies). We use a [custom Gatsby theme](https://github.com/apollographql/gatsby-theme-apollo/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-apollo-docs) to share common layouts, plugins, and data sourcing logic between sites. The following is a listing of docs websites that we manage, and links to their respective GitHub repos.

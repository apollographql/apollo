Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited you're here to learn about Apollo.

Apollo is a platform for building a **data graph**, a communication layer that seamlessly connects application clients (such as React and iOS apps) to back-end services.

It's easy to adopt Apollo incrementally, meaning you can set it up alongside an existing solution (such as a REST API) and migrate functionality at your convenience.

## Learn the basics

Conveniently, we have a [tutorial](/tutorial/introduction/) that introduces you to each component of the platform. Ready to dive in?

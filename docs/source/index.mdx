Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited you're here to learn about Apollo.

Apollo is a platform for building a **data graph**, a communication layer that seamlessly connects application clients (such as React and iOS apps) to back-end services.

It's easy to adopt Apollo incrementally, meaning you can set it up alongside an existing solution (such as a REST API) and migrate functionality at your convenience.

## Learn the basics

Conveniently, we have a [tutorial](/tutorial/introduction/) that introduces you to each component of the platform. Ready to dive in?

<div>
  <Button
    size="large"
    color={colors.primary}
    as={<Link to="/tutorial/introduction" />}
  >
    Start the tutorial!
  </Button>
  <Button
    size="large"
    as={<Link to="/intro/platform" />}
    style={{marginLeft: 16}}
  >
    Learn more
  </Button>
</div>

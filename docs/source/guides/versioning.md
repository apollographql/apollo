title: Versioning
description: What to know when evolving a GraphQL schema
---

Versioning is a technique to prevent necessary changes from becoming "breaking changes" which affect the existing consumers of an API.  These iterations might be as trivial as renaming a field, or as substantial as refactoring the whole data model.

Developers who have worked with REST APIs in the past have probably recognized various patterns for versioning the API, commonly by using a different URI (e.g. `/api/v1`, `/api/v2`, etc.) or a query parameter (e.g. `?version=1`).  With this technique, an application can easily end up with many different API endpoints over time, and the question of _when_ an API can be deprecated can become problematic.

It might be tempting to version a GraphQL API the same way, but it's unnecessary with the right techniques.  By following the strategies and precautions outlined in this guide and using Apollo tooling that adds clarity to every change, many iterations of an API can be served from a single endpoint.

<h2 id="field-usage">Understanding field usage</h2>

Rather than returning extensive amounts of data which might not be necessary, GraphQL allows consumers to specify exactly what data they need.  This field-based granularity is valuable and avoids "over-fetching" but also makes it more difficult to understand what data is currently being used.

To improve the understanding of field usage within an API, Apollo Server extends GraphQL with rich tracing data that demonstrates _how_ a GraphQL field is used and _when_ it's safe to change or eliminate a field.

> For details on how tracing data can be used to avoid shipping breaking changes to clients, check out the [schema history](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/engine/schema-history.html) tooling in [Apollo Engine](https://www.apollographql.com/engine) which utilizes actual usage data to provide warnings and notices about changes that might break existing clients.

<h2 id="additive">Additive changes</h2>

Since GraphQL clients only receive exactly what they ask for, adding new fields, arguments, queries, or mutations won't introduce any new breaking changes and these changes can be confidently made without consideration about existing clients or field usage metrics.

<h2 id="field-rollover">Field rollover</h2>

_Field rollover_ is a term given to an API change that's an evolution of a field, such as a rename or a change in arguments. Some of these changes can be really small, resulting in many variations and making an API harder to manage.

We'll go over these two kinds of field rollovers separately and show how to make these changes safely.

<h3 id="renaming-or-removing">Renaming or removing a field</h3>

When a field is unused, renaming or removing it is as straightforward as it sounds: it can be renamed or removed.  Unfortunately, if a GraphQL deployment doesn't have per-field usage metrics, additional considerations should be made.

Take the following `user` query as an example:

```graphql
type Query {
 user(id: ID!): User
}
```

We may want to rename it to `getUser` to be more descriptive of what the query is for, like so:

```graphql
type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

Even if that was the only change, this would be a breaking change for some clients, since those expecting a `user` query would receive error.

To make this change safely, instead of renaming the existing field we can simply add a new `getUser` field and leave the existing `user` field untouched. To prevent code duplication, the resolver logic can be shared between the two fields:

```js
const getUserResolver = (root, args, context) => {
  context.User.getById(args.id);
};

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    getUser: getUserResolver,
    user: getUserResolver,
  },
};
```

<h3 id="deprecating">Deprecating a field</h3>

The tactic we used works well to avoid breaking changes, but we still haven’t provided a way for consumers to know that they should switch to using the new field name. Luckily, the GraphQL specification provides a built-in `@deprecated` schema directive (sometimes called decorators in other languages):

```
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User @deprecated(reason: "renamed to 'getUser'")
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

GraphQL-aware client tooling, like GraphQL Playground and GraphiQL, use this information to assist developers in making the right choices.  These tools will:

* Provide developers with the helpful deprecation message referring them to the new name.
* Avoid auto-completing the field.

<h3 id="retiring">Retiring a deprecated field</h3>

Over time, usage will fall for the deprecated field and grow for the new field.

> Using tools like [Apollo Engine](https://www.apollographql.com/engine), it’s possible to make educated decisions about when to retire a field based on actual usage data through [schema analytics](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/engine/schema-analytics.html).

<h2 id="arguments">Changing arguments</h2>

<h3 id="non-breaking">Non-breaking changes</h3>

Sometimes we want to keep a field, but change how clients use it by adjusting its variables. For example, if we had a `getUsers` query that we used to fetch user data based off of a list of user `ids`, but wanted to change the arguments to support a `groupId` to look up users of a group or filter the users requested by the `ids` argument to only return users in the group:

```graphql
type Query {
  # what we have
  getUsers(ids: [ID!]!): [User]!

  # what we want to end up with
  getUsers(ids: [ID!], groupId: ID!): [User]!
}
```

Since this is an _additive_ change, and doesn't actually change the default behavior of the `getUsers` query, this isn't a breaking change!

<h3 id="breaking">Breaking changes</h3>

An example of a breaking change on an argument would be renaming (or deleting) an argument.

```graphql
type Query {
  # What we have.
  getUsers(ids: [ID!], groupId: ID!): [User]!

  # What we want to end up with.
  getUsers(ids: [ID!], groupIds: [ID!]): [User]!
}
```

There's no way to mark an argument as deprecated, but there are a couple options.

If we wanted to leave the old `groupId` argument active, we wouldn't need to do anything; adding a new argument isn't a breaking change as long as existing functionality doesn't change.

Instead of supporting it, if we wanted to remove the old argument, the safest option would be to create a new field and deprecate the current `getUsers` field.

Using an API management tool, like [Apollo Engine](https://www.apollographql.com/engine), it’s possible to determine when usage of an old field has dropped to an acceptable level and remove it.  The previously discussed [field rollover](#field-rollover) section gives more info on how to do that.

Of course, it’s also possible to leave the field in place indefinitely!

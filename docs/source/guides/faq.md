Everyone has questions about how to properly set up a GraphQL schema, but not all questions are alike. In different stages of development, different things matter. This guide will questions that people commonly have have at every step along the journey to GraphQL in production.

## Starting out

People in this phase are just learning GraphQL as a technology. They don't have any experience with it in the past, and are trying to get a sample project up and running.

- Where can I learn the basics?
- How do I write a schema?

- How do I wrap my existing APIs

## Initial Feature

People in this phase have decided to use GraphQL in production. They don't want to immediately refactor the APIs or apps. They want to move a single feature over to GraphQL to learn how to use it and monitor it in production.

- How do I set up authentication/authorization for my GraphQL schema?
- How can I monitor the health of my GraphQL schema?
- How do I discover and reproduce errors?

## Main Product

People in this phase have a good understanding of how to write, deploy, and monitor GraphQL in production. They are looking to scale GraphQL features to their entire product line.

- How can I structure my project to scale for the whole product?
- How can I test my client and server?

## Companywide Standard

People in this phase are very experienced with using GraphQL and have made the decision to try to move to GraphQL as a company-wide standard. They are interested in setting up processes and guidelines to make sure other teams with less experience will be successful.
